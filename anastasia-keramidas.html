      <p>IN <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">CONTENT Display Patterns</a>
(which all front-end folk should read), Dan Mall points to a truth unlike the one <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/">Ethan Marcotte shared last month</a>
on 24 ways. It is a truth as old as standards-based design: Construct your markup to properly support your content (not your design). </p>
<p> Modular/<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces its wisdom.
  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a>
  and <a href"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">grid layout</a>
  don’t change this truth, they just make it easier to do it better. HTML5 doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.
