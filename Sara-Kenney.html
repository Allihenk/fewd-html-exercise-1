  <p><img src="images/HTML.jpg">Never in all their <a href="#">history</a> have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

  </p>

  <p>Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.</p>

  <p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!
